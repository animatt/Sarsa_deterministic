# Sarsa_deterministic
Implementation of Sarsa on a deterministic windy gridworld

% This is an implementation of on-policy Sarsa that finds the optimal
% route across a 'windy' gridworld from an initial to a goal state. The
% agent is punished with a reward of -1 on each timestep as usual until
% termination.
